'''
Caching
-------

Itâ€™s important to understand the caching behaviour of jax.jit.

Suppose I define f = jax.jit(g). When I first invoke f, it will get compiled,
and the resulting XLA code will get cached. Subsequent calls of f will reuse
the cached code. This is how jax.jit makes up for the up-front cost of compilation.

If I specify static_argnums, then the cached code will be used only for the same
values of arguments labelled as static. If any of them change, recompilation occurs. If there are many values, then your program might spend more time compiling than it would have executing ops one-by-one.

Avoid calling jax.jit inside loops. For most cases, JAX will be able to use the
compiled, cached function in subsequent calls to jax.jit. However, because the
cache relies on the hash of the function, it becomes problematic when equivalent
functions are redefined. This will cause unnecessary compilation each time in the
loop.
